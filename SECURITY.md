# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to [amerfathullah@gmail.com](mailto:amerfathullah@gmail.com). I will review and respond to your report as soon as possible. If the issue is confirmed, I will take appropriate actions to mitigate the vulnerability and release a fix.

## Supported Versions

This project supports the latest version of the codebase on the main branch. Older versions may not receive security updates unless deemed necessary.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

I encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:
- Do not exploit the vulnerability or share details of it publicly before it has been resolved.
- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.

## Security Best Practices

### Dependencies

- Regularly update dependencies to their latest versions to avoid vulnerabilities in outdated packages.
- Use npm audit or yarn audit to check for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### Code Practices

- **Sanitize Inputs:** Always sanitize and validate inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Use Secure Libraries:** Use well-known and secure libraries for critical functionality.
- **Avoid Direct DOM Manipulation:** Prefer using React state and props to manipulate the DOM, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.

### Authentication and Authorization

- Use industry-standard practices for authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and secure storage mechanisms for tokens.
- Implement authorization checks on the server side to ensure users can only access authorized resources.

### HTTPS

- Ensure your server is configured to use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, preventing interception attacks.

### Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information.
- Provide informative error messages without revealing system details to users.

### Logging and Monitoring

- Monitor and log security-related events to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
